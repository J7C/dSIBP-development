MSConvertBasis::usage = "MSConvertBasis converts between ordered H/h state vectors locally or for a specified sector; sector conversion always reads the NuConvention of the initialized context, and integral objects continue to fail closed.";
MSToDSIBPJ::usage = "MSToDSIBPJ[integral,context] losslessly converts a MadStree time-only integral to a lazy dSIBP 020 J[sectorKey,timeShifts,stateBits]; further differentiation requires a dSIBP context matching the same sector/state-slot schema.";

MessageLanguage::usage = "MessageLanguage selects the language of runtime notices and diagnostics; the default is \"EN\" and \"CN\" selects Chinese.";
SingularityMode::usage = "SingularityMode selects path treatment: \"Automatic\" (default) follows user singular targets and uses the backend local route with a risk warning; \"Avoid\" explicitly refuses crossings; \"SingularityJump\" explicitly permits a multivalued singularity jump.";
FlintNDEPathPlanning::usage = "FlintNDEPathPlanning controls whether FlintNDE automatically plans nodes inside each MadStree affine segment. True (default) enables planning and fast dense multipoint evaluation; False uses the supplied user points strictly as transport nodes.";

EpGoalDigits::usage = "EpGoalDigits specifies the requested decimal accuracy of the reconstructed regulator coefficients and independent validation; the default is 20.";
MaximumEpPower::usage = "MaximumEpPower specifies the highest regulator power returned by MSReconstructEpSeries. The default is 0, which requests all detected pole terms and the finite part.";
EpFitExtraOrder::usage = "EpFitExtraOrder specifies how many powers above MaximumEpPower are fitted internally before independent validation. The default is 2.";
EpSamplePoints::usage = "EpSamplePoints specifies an ordered pool of exact nonzero regulator values. Automatic (default) preserves automatic point generation. With an explicit pool, each fitting round uses only the prefix required by its internal order and reuses solved points before consuming further candidates.";
EpSampleAngleRange::usage = "EpSampleAngleRange specifies an open regulator-angle interval {thetaMin,thetaMax} in radians for automatic complex sampling. The program chooses up to three uniformly spaced interior angles while retaining its precision-driven magnitude strategy. Automatic (default) preserves the positive-real-axis grid.";
EpValidationPoints::usage = "EpValidationPoints specifies exact nonzero regulator values reserved for independent validation. Automatic (default) preserves automatic validation-point generation. Explicit validation points must be distinct from every EpSamplePoints candidate and never enter the fit.";
EpInitialInternalMaximumPower::usage = "EpInitialInternalMaximumPower optionally specifies the highest regulator power fitted in the first round. Automatic (default) preserves the existing EpFitExtraOrder and empirical planning rule; an explicit value must not be below MaximumEpPower.";
EpFitOrderIncrement::usage = "EpFitOrderIncrement specifies how many additional internal powers and production points are added after a failed independent validation. The default is 2; existing point values are reused.";
EpFitMaximumRounds::usage = "EpFitMaximumRounds specifies the maximum number of incremental fitting rounds. The default is 3; reaching the limit without validation fails closed.";
NuConvention::usage = "NuConvention selects the prefactor of h=z^(+/-|nu|) H_|nu|; the default is \"Positive\", while \"Negative\" corresponds to 2401.";
BoundaryScale::usage = "BoundaryScale controls the distance of the finite starting point of the infinity Frobenius series from the boundary; it must be greater than 1.";
BoundarySeriesOrder::usage = "BoundarySeriesOrder specifies the total degree truncation of the infinity Frobenius boundary series.";
RankOrder::usage = "RankOrder specifies the vertex id order from largest to smallest damping energy; by default it is determined by the target point.";

TransportOrder::usage = "TransportOrder specifies the local series order of the primary FlintNDE transport chain.";
ReferenceTransportOrder::usage = "ReferenceTransportOrder specifies the local series order of the reference FlintNDE transport chain.";
TargetRelativeError::usage = "TargetRelativeError specifies the endpoint relative-difference target between the primary and reference FlintNDE chains.";
MasterBasis::usage = "MasterBasis specifies the full ordering of master integrals output by MSReduce; by default the context-fixed order is used.";
TimePowerRules::usage = "TimePowerRules specifies optional substitution rules for the vertex time powers a_i in formula products; by default Automatic keeps them symbolic.";
ParameterRules::usage = "ParameterRules specifies one-time numerical substitutions for parameters that are not columns of the MSEvaluatePath pointSequence. Together with the pointSequence header it must cover every symbol required by the analytic dlog DE and boundary; otherwise NDE does not start.";
MSOutputDirectory::usage = "MSOutputDirectory specifies the formula-product directory; relative paths are resolved against the calling script directory, and by default products are written to results/madstree_formula/run-UUID under the calling directory.";
MSExportEvaluationData::usage = "MSExportEvaluationData[evaluation] exports saved ordinary-point records from one MSEvaluatePath result to CSV and JSON. Transient records are not exported. Options: MSOutputDirectory, ExportFormats and SignificantDigits.";
MSEvaluatePath::usage = "MSEvaluatePath[context,pointSequence] evaluates a coordinate table whose first row is the ordered coordinate-symbol header and whose later rows are equal-width point values. A single point is {{x1,...},{v1,...}}; multiple points only append value rows. Parameters not used as running coordinates are supplied once with ParameterRules. A transient waypoint is written as {{v1,...},\"tmp\"}. Before Python/FlintNDE starts, the complete analytic formula artifacts are written or reused and their paths are returned under formulaArtifacts. The analytic dlog DE remains unchanged; a local parameter-substituted copy is pulled back once per maximal consecutive complex-affine segment and sent to FlintNDE. WorkingPrecision defaults to 200. FlintNDEPathPlanning->True enables backend node planning and fast dense multipoint evaluation; False uses every supplied point as a node in order.";
MSReconstructEpSeries::usage = "MSReconstructEpSeries[context,ep,pointSequence,MaximumEpPower->0] uses the same pointSequence header/value table and ParameterRules contract as MSEvaluatePath. ParameterRules may depend on ep, while pointSequence coordinates may not. Before any numerical NDE, the complete analytic formula artifacts are written or reused and returned under formulaArtifacts. The function certifies the lowest integer ep power from the symbolic boundary condition and analytic dlog DE before any numerical solve and reconstructs all Laurent coefficients through MaximumEpPower. EpSamplePoints may provide a redundant ordered pool of exact regulator values; EpSampleAngleRange may instead select an open complex-angle interval while magnitudes remain precision-driven. Failed validation consumes further points while reusing solved values. If available candidates are exhausted, the current best coefficients are returned with precisionTargetMet->False rather than being discarded. EpValidationPoints optionally fixes the disjoint independent-check points. EpInitialInternalMaximumPower may override the first-round internal highest power. EpFitExtraOrder->2, EpGoalDigits->20, EpFitOrderIncrement->2, EpFitMaximumRounds->3 and ParallelTaskCount->12 remain the defaults.";
